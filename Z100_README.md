* incresed level cap to 100
* incresed tallent points to 120 gaining points the same after level 50 as you did up to 50
* incresed solo talent points to 50 gaining the same after level 50 as you did up to 50

***NOTES***
* if you have played alot after reaching level 50 this mod will take that expience in to acount when installed putting you at the appropriate level
* it is posible that you will instantly be at level 100. if you would like to have the expierence of leveling up thrue the levels as I did you can edit your charecters xp value to roghly 3900000. this will put your charactor most of the way thru level 50.
* the file containing your charactors xp value shold be located C:\Users\:Username:\AppData\Local\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\:IDNumber:\Characters.json
* use the points as soon as you get them to avoid losing them  I think the next level up would give them back again for the time but have not tested this.
