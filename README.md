# Zailfyers Icarus Mods
Some mods I have created for Icarus

# MXC Cot
* Its no longer nesisary to have a mod to access the MXC Cot
* changes the vanila location to the old modded location in the workshop
* makes the MXC Cot require reseaching the MXC campfire
* makes the MXC Cot lighter weight

# Zailfyers 100 Level Cap
* Incresed level cap to 100
* Increased talent points to 150 gaining points the same after level 60 as you did up to 60
* Increased solo talent points to 50 gaining the same after level 60 as you did up to 60

***NOTES***
* If you have played a lot after reaching level 60 this mod will take that expience in to account when installed putting you at the appropriate level
* It is posible that you will instantly be at level 100. If you would like to have the expierence of leveling up through the levels as I did, you can edit your characters xp value to roughly 5,472,000. This will put your character most of the way through level 60.
* The file containing your characters xp value should be located C:\Users\:Username:\AppData\Local\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\:IDNumber:\Characters.json
* Use the points as soon as you get them to avoid losing them. I think the next level up would give them back again but have not tested this.
