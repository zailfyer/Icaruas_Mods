# Zailfyers Icarus Mods
Some mods I have created for Icarus

# MXC Cot
* Grants Access to the MXC Cot in the orbital workshop
* Now you can drop in to a prospect with a bed!

# Zailfyers 100 Level Cap
* incresed level cap to 100
* incresed tallent points to 150 gaining points the same after level 60 as you did up to 60
* incresed solo talent points to 50 gaining the same after level 60 as you did up to 60

***NOTES***
* if you have played alot after reaching level 60 this mod will take that expience in to acount when installed putting you at the appropriate level
* it is posible that you will instantly be at level 100. if you would like to have the expierence of leveling up thrue the levels as I did, you can edit your charecters xp value to roghly 5472000. this will put your charactor most of the way thru level 60.
* the file containing your charactors xp value shold be located C:\Users\:Username:\AppData\Local\Icarus\Saved\PlayerData\:IDNumber:\Characters.json
* use the points as soon as you get them to avoid losing them. I think the next level up would give them back again but have not tested this.
